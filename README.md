Hey there, people! My name is Sarah Christine Bland and my main squeezes are Jesus, frisbaes (my ultimate teammates), and pizza. 

This is me trying to figure out how to be a real computer scientist! Being competent (or maybe even "really good" someday) at CS is becoming an increasingly important aspiration for me... hopefully gitHub will help me keep track of that progress! (:
